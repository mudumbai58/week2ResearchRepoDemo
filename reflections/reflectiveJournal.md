# Reflective Journal

## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a visual programming language that allows students to create their own interactive stories, games and animations. As students design Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively.
### What is visual programming?
A visual programming language (VPL) is a computer program that develops applications using graphical components and figures. A VPL uses methods to create a two- or three-dimensional software that contains graphical components, text, symbols, and icons inside its programming environment.
### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
Code indentation: Proper indentation is the most important thing you can do to ensure that your code is readable and easy to understand.                          Meaningful naming: Your code’s variable names and function names should be intuitive. Ideally, we should be able to guess what a function does based on the function’s name.                                                                                                                                                              Comments: Code is for the compiler, while comments are for coders. Even if other best practices are accounted for, source code can’t always be self-explanatory. When code can’t explain itself, comments should step in. Here, good practices for writing stories apply to writing code: The more you anticipate your reader’s thoughts, the more impactful your comments will be.                                                                                                                                       Don’t repeat yourself: Also known as the DRY principle, “Don’t repeat yourself” strives to reduce code duplication. The idea here is that if you have code that’s doing the same thing twice, it should be made into a function. 
### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
