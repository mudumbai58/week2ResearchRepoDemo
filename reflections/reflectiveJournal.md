## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a visual programming language that allows students to create their own interactive stories, games and animations. As students design Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively.
### What is visual programming?
A visual programming language (VPL) is a computer program that develops applications using graphical components and figures. A VPL uses methods to create a two- or three-dimensional software that contains graphical components, text, symbols, and icons inside its programming environment.
### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
Code indentation: Proper indentation is the most important thing you can do to ensure that your code is readable and easy to understand.                          Meaningful naming: Your code’s variable names and function names should be intuitive. Ideally, we should be able to guess what a function does based on the function’s name.                                                                                                                                                              Comments: Code is for the compiler, while comments are for coders. Even if other best practices are accounted for, source code can’t always be self-explanatory. When code can’t explain itself, comments should step in. Here, good practices for writing stories apply to writing code: The more you anticipate your reader’s thoughts, the more impactful your comments will be.                                                                                                                                       Don’t repeat yourself: Also known as the DRY principle, “Don’t repeat yourself” strives to reduce code duplication. The idea here is that if you have code that’s doing the same thing twice, it should be made into a function. 
### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?

## Week 2:

### What is git?
Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.
Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.
According to a Stack Overflow developer survey, over 87% of developers use Git.
### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.

GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.

GitHub is so user-friendly, though, that some people even use GitHub to manage other types of projects – like writing books.

Additionally, anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, which makes GitHub especially popular with open-source projects.

As a company, GitHub makes money by selling hosted private code repositories, as well as other business-focused plans that make it easier for organizations to manage team members and security. We utilize Github extensively at Kinsta to manage and develop internal projects.
